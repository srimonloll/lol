<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Srimon Anida. Currently I am interested in psychology and digital marketing. During summer I was a digital marketing intern aand created Instagram posts for a BIPOC/POC market. Overall, I find it more of as something to do on my own time and career wise hope to go into psycology and understand people's minds and why we are the way we are. For now I am learning about GitHub and expanding my knowledge on thi site. I'm looking to collaborate on branches and uploading my work for the public and since it is my first time, my standards for myself aren't high, but overtime I believe will become something I enjoy.  </p>
